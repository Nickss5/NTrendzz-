This is my first ever E-commerce Platform! Check it out here ðŸ‘‰ [https://NTrendzz.ccbp.tech](https://NTrendzz.ccbp.tech)

I created a front-end clone of an e-commerce website, featuring a user interface that allows users to:

- **The stack I'm using**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ReactJs, JWT, REST APIs, local storage
- **Login**: Securely authenticate users including some Prime Users.
- **Navigate Pages**: Browse various sections including Home, Products, Cart, and more.
- **Product Management**: View filtering products, product details, and add items to the shopping cart.

-  Prime User credentials

    ```text
     username: rahul
     password: rahul@2021
    ```

- Non-Prime User credentials

  ```text
   username: raja
   password: raja@2021
  ```

This project focuses on the user interface aspects, replicating the look and feel of a real e-commerce platform, while implementing core functionalities such as user authentication and cart management.
