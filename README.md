This is my first ever E-commerce Platform! Check it out here ðŸ‘‰ ![](https://NTrendzz.ccbp.tech)

I created a front-end clone of an e-commerce website, featuring a user interface that allows users to:

Login: Securely authenticate users.
Navigate Pages: Browse various sections including Home, Products, Cart, and more.
Product Management: View filtering products, product details and add items to the shopping cart.
This project focuses on the user interface aspects, replicating the look and feel of a real e-commerce platform, while implementing core functionalities such as user authentication and cart management.
